    <h1>History of the world wide web</h1>
    <i>The internet is becoming the town square,<br>
      for the global village of tommorow. - Bill Gates
    </i>

    <h2>Motivation?</h2>
    <p>While working at CERN, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee was frustrated at how inefficient and difficult it was to retrieve stored information from the various <br> 
    computers at the facility. This led him to make a proposal of a system where all the references in a document being associated with the network address of <br> 
    the thing to which they referred to. This was the idea of a <em>hypertext</em>. Not long after, he invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Then a year later, he invented the first web browser.</p>

    <h2> Web-spinning Arachnids </h2>
    <p> <em> A web of what exactly? </em> <br>
    The world wide web can be considered as a graph. With information at the nodes and hyperlinks acting as the graphs directed edges, pointing to and <br>
    connecting all the mess of both useful and useless media together in an intricate digital cob-web.
