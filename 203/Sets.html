	<h1>What is a set?</h1>
	<p>A <em>well defined</em> collection of objects. And, each such object can also be termed as an <em>element</em> of this set.</p>
	<h3>Okay, but what do you mean by something being "well-defined"?</h3>
	<p>From what I can gather, if a collection of objects can be described by some <mark>objective fact</mark><br> it's safe to assume that the collection is well-defined and hence it qualifies as a set.</p>
	<p>A collection that is based on subjective fact, for e.g., A person's list of favourite movie actors, cannot be considered a set. <em>No matter how much he/she convinces others that it is objective.</em></p>
	<p>In other words, a set is something that is free from all kinds of biases. Something that remains unchanged no matter who decides to sit down and construct it.</p>
	<h3>Representations</h3>
	<p>Sets can be represented in two ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Roster or Tabular form</li>
		<li>Set-builder form</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In the <mark>Roster form</mark>, elements of the set are enclosed inside curly braces with each of them being separated by commas. Duplicate elements are redundent and therefore not listed.</p>
	<pre>
		For example,
			Let A be the set of natural numbers less than 4,
			then A = {1, 2, 3}
	</pre>
